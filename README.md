# Javascript-Concepts
This repository holds a collection of my JavaScript practice files and exercises. It's organized to cover fundamental concepts, from data types and operators to functions, loops, and conditional statements. Each file or folder is dedicated to a specific topic, serving as a personal resource for learning and demonstrating core JavaScript skills.
