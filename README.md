# Javascript-Concepts
This repository holds a collection of my JavaScript practice files and exercises. It's organized to cover fundamental concepts, from data types and operators to functions, loops, and conditional statements. Each file or folder is dedicated to a specific topic, serving as a personal resource for learning and demonstrating core JavaScript skills.


# JavaScript Concepts & Exercises

This repository is a comprehensive collection of my JavaScript practice files, organized by concept. It serves as a personal resource for solidifying my understanding of fundamental JavaScript topics.

## Project Structure

The repository contains two main types of content:

### 1. Individual JavaScript Files
A collection of standalone `.js` files, each focusing on a specific exercise or concept.
- `arrays_02`: An exercise related to arrays.
- `breaking_outloop`: Demonstrates how to break out of a loop.
- `built_in_func`: Examples of using built-in JavaScript functions.
- `car_payment`: A potential script for a car payment calculation.
- `functions`: A basic introduction to functions.
- `mad_labs_01`: A coding challenge or "mad lib" style exercise.
- `replt_it`: A project from the Replit platform.
- `switch_03`: A more advanced or third exercise using a `switch` statement.
- `while_lopp`: A demonstration of a `while` loop.

### 2. Concept Folders
A set of folders, each containing exercises related to a specific topic.
- **`Arrays`**: A folder dedicated to array methods and operations.
- **`Loops`**: Includes `for_loop`, `dowhile_loop`, and `while_loop` folders with exercises.
- **`Operators`**: Separate folders for `Arthemic_operators`, `Assingment_operators`, and `comparision_operators`.
- **`Conditional Statements`**: Folders for `conditional`, `if_else`, and `switch` statements.
- **`Functions`**: `functions`, `func_params`, and `func_return` demonstrate different aspects of functions.
- **`Variables`**: Basic exercises on defining and using variables.

## How to Run the Code

To run any of the JavaScript files, you can use a few methods:
1.  **Browser Console**: Link an HTML file to the `.js` file and view the output in your browser's developer console.
2.  **Node.js**: Open your terminal, navigate to the file's location, and run `node <filename>.js`.
